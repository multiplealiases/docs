## Making a Bootable USB

{: .warning }
Flashing Ventoy or ISO's to an external drive will **wipe all data** on said drive. Back up anything if you have to.

### Prerequisites
1. Another PC or laptop with at least 8GB storage
2. A internet connection
3. A external drive like a USB drive or SD card thats at least 8 gigabytes.

### Downloading a ISO
1. Determine what OS you want.
   - For Linux, keep in mind Ubuntu and any derivatives will not work.
   - For Windows, keep in mind only Windows 10 and newer are supported.
2. Place the ISO in a safe place.


### Flashing using Rufus (Windows)

For this guide, we will be using Rufus to create our bootable USB. 

1. Download Rufus from [here](https://rufus.ie/en/). The standard Windows x64 version will do.
